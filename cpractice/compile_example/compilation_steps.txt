compilation stages
1. Preprocessing: it can be done using -E flag with gcc and it will preprocess all
   directives started with #.

ex: $gcc -E -o helloworld helloworld.c           
/* The above command will produce helloworld file with expanded preprocessor directives */

2. Compilation: Using -S flag with gcc we can only compile the program and get the
   human readable assembly code.

ex: $gcc -S -o helloworld helloworld.c           
/* The above command will produce helloworld file with assembly code corresponding to the architecture */


3. Assembly: Using -c we can convert c program to assembly code or object code.



memory layout of the c program or process:
using below command we can know the memory usage of each block like
text, data, bss, dec, hex, filename

$gcc helloworld.c -o memory-layout
$size memory-layout
